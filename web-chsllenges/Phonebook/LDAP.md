The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a vendor-neutral software protocol used to lookup information or devices within a network. Whether you want to build a central authentication server for your organization or want to simplify access to internal servers and printers, LDAP is the answer.

## What is LDAP?

standard protocol designed to maintain and access “directory services” within a network. Think of a directory service as a phonebook for different network resources like files, printers, users, devices, and servers, etc.

For example, an organization may store information for all their printers in a directory. LDAP can enable users to search for a specific printer, locate it on the network, and securely connect to it.

LDAP is widely used to build central authentication servers. These servers contain usernames and passwords for all the users within a network. Any-and-all applications and services can connect to the LDAP server to authenticate and authorize users.

 LDAP directory servers use a flexible schema, which means they can  store a variety of attributes, including user credentials, phone numbers, group associations, and more, in the format that meets the organization’s needs. As a result, a common LDAP use case is to store core user identities. 

Because LDAP directories can store user data and credentials, they can act as the source of truth for LDAP authentication. In an LDAP authentication transaction, the user inputs their credentials via a system or application, which are then compared to those stored within the _LDAP directory database_. If they match, the user is authenticated and granted access.
