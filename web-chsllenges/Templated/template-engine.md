A template engine in Python is a tool that allows you to separate the presentation logic from the business logic in your web application. The template engine provides a way to write templates, which are files that define how the final HTML pages should look, and then render them with dynamic data to generate the final output.

In other words, a template engine provides a way to create dynamic web pages that can be customized with data from a database or other sources.

Python has several popular template engines, including Jinja2, Django templates, and Mako. These template engines provide a syntax for writing templates that can include placeholders for dynamic data, as well as control structures like loops and conditionals.

For example, here is a simple Jinja2 template that uses placeholders to display a dynamic message:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
In this example, the `{{ title }}` and `{{ message }}` placeholders will be replaced with dynamic data when the template is rendered.

Using a template engine can help make your web application more maintainable, since it allows you to separate the presentation logic from the business logic. It can also make it easier to create consistent-looking pages, since you can reuse the same templates across multiple pages.
