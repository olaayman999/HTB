Server-side template injection (SSTI) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur in web applications that use server-side templates. In SSTI attacks, an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a template that is then executed on the server, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions or obtain sensitive information.

SSTI attacks can occur when an application allows user input to be included in a template without proper validation or sanitization. This can happen in a variety of ways, including:

User-supplied input in a form field or URL parameter is used to construct a template name or template code that is executed on the server.

User-supplied input is included in a template variable without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject their own template code.

User-supplied input is included in a template tag that is executed on the server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

SSTI attacks can be particularly dangerous because they allow an attacker to execute code on the server, which can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities. To prevent SSTI attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize all user input that is used in templates, as well as to use secure coding practices such as input validation and output encoding. Additionally, using a well-tested and secure template engine can help to mitigate the risk of SSTI attacks.


---------------------------------------

There have been several CVEs related to Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in Flask and Jinja2. Here are some notable ones:

`CVE-2019-1010083`: This vulnerability affects Jinja2 2.10 and earlier versions, and could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted template. This vulnerability was fixed in Jinja2 2.10.1 and later versions.

`CVE-2020-28493`: This vulnerability affects Flask versions before 1.1.2, and could allow an attacker to perform SSTI attacks via the flask.templating module. This vulnerability was fixed in Flask 1.1.2.

`CVE-2021-23336`: This vulnerability affects Jinja2 versions before 2.11.3, and could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted template. This vulnerability was fixed in Jinja2 2.11.3 and later versions.

If you are using Flask or Jinja2 in your web application, it is important to keep your software up to date and to follow best practices for web application security to minimize the risk of SSTI attacks. This includes properly validating and sanitizing user input, using a secure template engine, and following the principle of least privilege by limiting access to sensitive resources.

## explain {{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }} 

The string `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}` is an example of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) payload that can be used to execute arbitrary code on a web server using the Jinja2 template engine.

Here's how it works:

`{{` and `}}` are special delimiters in Jinja2 that indicate the start and end of a template expression.

`cycler.__init__` refers to the `__init__` method of the `cycler` class in Python. The `__init__` method is a special method that is called when an object of the class is created.

`__globals__` is a special attribute of a Python function that returns a **dictionary** representing the global namespace of the function.

`os` is a Python **module** that provides a way to interact with the operating system.

`popen` is a method of the `os` module that allows you to execute a command as a subprocess and return the output.

'`id`' is the command that is passed to `popen` to be executed as a subprocess. The `id` command is a common Unix/Linux command that returns information about the current user and their privileges.

`read()` is a method that is called on the output of the popen command to read and return the output.

When this payload is injected into a Jinja2 template and the template is rendered, the code will be executed on the server and the output of the `id` command will be returned and displayed on the page.

It's important to note that this payload is just an example and should not be used to attack a real website or server. SSTI vulnerabilities can be extremely dangerous and can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or take control of the server. Web developers should take steps to prevent SSTI vulnerabilities by properly validating and sanitizing user input, using a secure template engine, and following best practices for web application security.
