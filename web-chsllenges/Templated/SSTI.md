Server-side template injection (SSTI) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur in web applications that use server-side templates. In SSTI attacks, an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a template that is then executed on the server, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions or obtain sensitive information.

SSTI attacks can occur when an application allows user input to be included in a template without proper validation or sanitization. This can happen in a variety of ways, including:

User-supplied input in a form field or URL parameter is used to construct a template name or template code that is executed on the server.

User-supplied input is included in a template variable without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject their own template code.

User-supplied input is included in a template tag that is executed on the server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

SSTI attacks can be particularly dangerous because they allow an attacker to execute code on the server, which can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities. To prevent SSTI attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize all user input that is used in templates, as well as to use secure coding practices such as input validation and output encoding. Additionally, using a well-tested and secure template engine can help to mitigate the risk of SSTI attacks.


---------------------------------------

There have been several CVEs related to Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in Flask and Jinja2. Here are some notable ones:

`CVE-2019-1010083`: This vulnerability affects Jinja2 2.10 and earlier versions, and could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted template. This vulnerability was fixed in Jinja2 2.10.1 and later versions.

`CVE-2020-28493`: This vulnerability affects Flask versions before 1.1.2, and could allow an attacker to perform SSTI attacks via the flask.templating module. This vulnerability was fixed in Flask 1.1.2.

`CVE-2021-23336`: This vulnerability affects Jinja2 versions before 2.11.3, and could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted template. This vulnerability was fixed in Jinja2 2.11.3 and later versions.

If you are using Flask or Jinja2 in your web application, it is important to keep your software up to date and to follow best practices for web application security to minimize the risk of SSTI attacks. This includes properly validating and sanitizing user input, using a secure template engine, and following the principle of least privilege by limiting access to sensitive resources.

## explain {{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }} 

The string `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}` is an example of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) payload that can be used to execute arbitrary code on a web server using the Jinja2 template engine.

Here's how it works:

`{{` and `}}` are special delimiters in Jinja2 that indicate the start and end of a template expression.

`cycler.__init__` refers to the `__init__` method of the `cycler` class in Python. The `__init__` method is a special method that is called when an object of the class is created.

`__globals__` is a special attribute of a Python function that returns a **dictionary** representing the global namespace of the function.

`os` is a Python **module** that provides a way to interact with the operating system.

`popen` is a method of the `os` module that allows you to execute a command as a subprocess and return the output.

'`id`' is the command that is passed to `popen` to be executed as a subprocess. The `id` command is a common Unix/Linux command that returns information about the current user and their privileges.

`read()` is a method that is called on the output of the popen command to read and return the output.

When this payload is injected into a Jinja2 template and the template is rendered, the code will be executed on the server and the output of the `id` command will be returned and displayed on the page.

----------------------------

## what is cycler class in python


`cycler` is a Python package that provides a way to **create and manipulate cyclic lists or arrays**. Cyclic lists or arrays are lists or arrays that repeat themselves after a certain number of elements.

For example, a cyclic list of length 3 might look like `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...]`.

The `cycler` package provides a `Cycler` class that allows you to create and manipulate cyclic lists or arrays. The `Cycler` class is a subclass of the built-in `list` class in Python, and provides additional functionality for creating, manipulating, and iterating over cyclic lists or arrays.

Here's an example of how to create a cyclic list of colors using cycler:

```python
from cycler import cycler
#
colors = cycler('color', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])
```
This creates a cyclic list of colors with three elements: '`red`', '`green`', and '`blue`'. The `cycler` function is used to create a `Cycler` object, which is then used to create the `cyclic` list. The first argument to cycler specifies the name of the cycle, and the second argument specifies the values in the cycle.

Overall, the cycler package provides a convenient way to create and manipulate cyclic lists or arrays in Python, which can be useful in a variety of applications.

-----------------------------
## does every class in python have __init__

No, not every class in Python has an `__init__` method. However, most classes in Python will have an `__init__` method, which is a special method that gets called when an object is created from the class.

The `__init__` method is used to initialize the object's attributes or properties. It takes the `self` parameter as its first argument, which **refers to the object being created**. The `self` parameter is used to access and set the object's attributes or properties.

Here's an example of a simple Python class with an `__init__` method:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

In this example, the `Person` class has an `__init__` method that takes two parameters, `name` and `age`, and sets the name and age attributes of the object using the self parameter.

When an object is created from the `Person` class, the `__init__` method will be called **automatically**, and the name and age attributes will be set:

```python

person1 = Person('Alice', 25)
print(person1.name) # Output: Alice
print(person1.age) # Output: 25
```
In summary, while not every class in Python will have an `__init__` method, it is a common practice to use `__init__` as a way to initialize the object's attributes or properties when it is created.

-----------------------------------------
## so this mean that __init__ is a constructor?

Yes, that's correct. In object-oriented programming, the `__init__` method is often referred to as a constructor, because it gets called when an object is constructed (i.e., created) from the class.

The `__init__` method is responsible for initializing the object's attributes or properties, so that the object is in a valid and usable state. It is similar to a constructor in other programming languages like Java or C++, which are also responsible for initializing an object's state.

Here's an example of a simple `__init__` method that sets some attributes for an object:

```python

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
```
In this example, the Car class has an` __init__` method that takes three parameters, `make`, `model`, and `year`, and sets the corresponding attributes of the object using the self parameter.

When an object is created from the Car class, the` __init__` method will be called automatically, and the make, model, and year attributes will be set:

```python

my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2021)
print(my_car.make) # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.model) # Output: Camry
print(my_car.year) # Output: 2021
```
So in Python, the `__init__` method serves as the constructor for the class, which initializes the object's attributes when it is created.

-------------------------------------------
## why did the above payload choose the cycler class?

The specific payload you mentioned, `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}`, is an example of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) exploit that leverages the cycler module in Python.

The reason that `cycler` is being used in this example is because `cycler` is a widely-used Python library that provides functionality for generating cyclic patterns in plots.

When Flask's **default** Jinja2 template engine is used, it _automatically loads all Python modules that are available in the current environment, which includes the cycler module if it's installed.
_

Once the `cycler` module is loaded, the exploit uses the `__init__` method of the cycler class to gain access to the global namespace of the application. From there, it uses the `os.popen()` function to execute a system command (in this case, id) and reads the output.

The exploit is successful because the` __init__` method of a class is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created. By accessing the `__init__` method of a built-in class like `cycler`, the attacker is able to gain access to the global namespace and execute arbitrary code.

other classes are 
```bash
<class 'jinja2.utils.MissingType'>, <class 'jinja2.utils.LRUCache'>, <class 'jinja2.utils.Cycler'>, <class 'jinja2.utils.Joiner'>, <class 'jinja2.utils.Namespace'>, <class 'jinja2.bccache.Bucket'>
```
which are also used in the current app

---------------------------------------------

## what is global namespace of python application?

The global namespace of a Python application refers to the collection of all variable names and values that are available to the program at any given time. In other words, it is the set of variables, functions, and other objects that have been defined in the program, and that can be accessed from any part of the program.

When a Python program starts running, it **creates a global namespace that includes all of the built-in Python functions and modules, as well as any variables, functions, or other objects that have been defined in the program up to that point**. As the program runs, new variables, functions, and other objects may be created and added to the global namespace, or existing ones may be modified or deleted.

In the context of a web application, the global namespace typically includes all of the variables and functions that are defined in the application's code, as well as any modules or packages that have been imported into the application. When a user makes a request to the application, **the code runs within the global namespace, and any changes to the state of the application (such as changes to the value of a variable) are stored in the global namespace.**

It is important to note that the global namespace is shared across all parts of the program, which means that any changes made to the global namespace in one part of the program will be visible in all other parts of the program. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or bugs, especially in large or complex programs. Therefore, it is generally a good practice to limit the use of global variables and to encapsulate code in functions or classes as much as possible, in order to reduce the risk of unintended side effects or conflicts.

## so this means that the os module is global?

Yes, that's correct. The `os` module is a built-in Python module that provides a way to interact with the operating system in a platform-independent way. When a Python application is running, the `os` module is available in the global namespace by default, along with all of the other built-in modules and functions.

This means that any part of the application can use the `os` module to perform operations such as accessing the file system, creating new processes, or interacting with the network.

However, it's important to keep in mind that using functions from the os module can potentially have security implications, especially in the context of a web application.

For example, as we saw in the earlier example, an attacker could use the `os.popen()` function to execute arbitrary commands on the server if the application is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). Therefore, it's generally a good practice to be cautious when using functions from the os module, and to carefully validate and sanitize any input that is passed to them.

## what are other common modules in the global namespace

In addition to the `os` module, there are many other built-in modules that are commonly available in the global namespace of a Python application. Some examples of other commonly used modules include:

`sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, such as the command-line arguments passed to the program, or the version of Python being used.

`math` : Provides mathematical functions and constants, such as sine and cosine, pi, and the square root function.

`random`: Provides functions for generating random numbers and selecting random items from lists.

`datetime`: Provides classes for working with dates and times, such as datetime, date, and time.

`re`: Provides regular expression matching operations.

`json`: Provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data.

`csv`: Provides classes for working with comma-separated value (CSV) files.

These modules are included in the** standard library that comes with Python**, which means that they are **available by default** when Python is installed on a system.

In addition, there are many third-party modules that can be installed and used in Python applications, which can add additional functionality to the global namespace.

-----------------------------------------
## why the payload used __init__.__globals__

The payload `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}` uses the `__init__.__globals__` attribute to access the global namespace of the `__init__` method of the `cycler` class.

In Python, **every method of a class has its own namespace**, which contains the names of the arguments and any local variables defined within the method. However,** each method can also access the global namespace of the module in which it is defined by using the `globals()` function.**

In this case, the payload uses the `__globals__` attribute to directly access the global namespace of the `__init__` method, rather than using the `globals()` function. This is possible because the `__globals__` attribute is a **reference to the global namespace of the module **in which the method is defined.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## how to know the classes used in a python app

using the payload
```bash
{{ app.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}
```

This payload uses the `__class__` attribute to get a reference to the class object of the app instance, and then accesses the `__mro__` attribute to get a tuple of the method resolution order of the class. Finally, it uses the `__subclasses__()` method to get a list of all the subclasses of the class object.

--------------------------------

## what is the difference between python module, class, library

In Python, a module is a file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. A module is typically used to organize related code into a single unit that can be imported and used by other parts of a program. Modules are usually stored in files with a `.py` extension.

A class, on the other hand, is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that define the behavior and properties of the objects that belong to that class. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword and can be instantiated to create objects.

**A library is a collection of related modules** that can be used to perform a specific task or provide a set of related functions. A library can include multiple modules, classes, and functions that work together to provide a complete set of tools for a specific purpose.

In summary, modules contain Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables, while classes define blueprints for creating objects with a specific set of behaviors and properties. Libraries are collections of related modules, classes, and functions that work together to provide a complete set of tools for a specific purpose.

------------------------------------

### "When a Python application is running, the os module is available in the global namespace by default, along with all of the other built-in modules and functions." if it posses a security risk, why is it enabled by default 

The `os` module is one of the built-in modules in Python, and it provides a wide range of functions for interacting with the operating system, such as creating and deleting files, managing directories, and executing external commands. It is an essential part of the** Python standard library **and is used by many Python applications.

While the `os` module is a powerful tool, it can also be dangerous if used improperly. Some of its functions can be used to perform actions that could compromise the security of the system or the application running on it. For example, the `os.system` function can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the system, which can be a security risk if the command is supplied by an untrusted user.

However, despite the potential security risks, the `os` module is enabled by default in Python because it is an essential part of the language and is needed for many common tasks. It is up to the developers and system administrators to ensure that their code and applications are written securely and that they take appropriate measures to mitigate the risks associated with using the os module or any other potentially dangerous functions or modules.
