Telnet is a protocol that allows a user to connect to a remote computer over the internet or a local network. It is a client-server protocol, where the Telnet client runs on the user's computer and the Telnet server runs on the remote computer.

Once a Telnet connection is established, the user can use the command line interface of the remote computer to perform various tasks such as running programs, accessing files, and executing commands. Telnet was widely used in the early days of the internet as a way to remotely access and manage network devices and servers.

Telnet has largely been replaced by more secure protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell), which encrypts the data sent over the connection to prevent unauthorized access. However, Telnet is still used in some situations, such as for testing and troubleshooting network connections.
